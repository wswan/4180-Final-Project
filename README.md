# 4180-Final-Project: The Money Machine
Repo for final project for a class, a bluetooth robot that uses sonar to detect and annoy roommates

## Ok but what is the money machine?

Well, it plays Money Machine by 100 gecs a lot, but that's the byproduct of my "very good design decisions". Basically, I wanted to make something goofy with the robot chassis that I didn't use

Said goofy thing is a robot to annoy my roommates, using a sonar to detect motion in front of the robot which plays a horrendously downsampled Money Machine and LEDs to the beat when motion is detected

Also said robot is Bluetooth controlled so anyone with a Bluefruit app can annoy the people around them!
But I mainly annoyed myself when building this thing

Such is the life of the engineer
